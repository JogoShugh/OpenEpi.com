<!-- This sample shell for developing OpenEpi applications contains the
code for statistics for a simple binary proportion.  This should be removed
and replaced with your own code for setting up the input table and for producing
suitable output for your application.  Statistical code goes in the SHELL.js
file, which should be renamed.  The images on this menu can be GIF or JPG
screen grabs of input and output from your program, or other suitable
images.  

The OpenEpi Toolkit provides methods for configuring a data entry page and 
for constructing HTML output to display statistical results.  The Etable
directory containing Etable.htm, Settings.htm, and StdPage.css, and the sub-
directory, ETable_Files, must be present for the input and output functions 
to work. 


This is an Open Source project to which the "MIT License" is applied. It was
supported in part by a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to
Emory University to enhance the statistical capabilities of Epi Info, a public
domain software package produced by the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

   The following "if" statement acts on an entry in row 1 (the numerator in this
   case).  It muliplies the entry by 43 and sets the cell in row 1, column 2, to
  the result.  Then, to illustrate how to retrieve a value from the input table,
  it retrieves the value just set and displays it in an alert box.  The routine
  is nonsense, but it illustrates how to both get and set values from cells 
  in the input table.  Note that the user's entry in the current cell, and the
  row and column of the current cell are passed in the parameters of this
  function, and that the value of the current cell has not yet been set. It 
  will be set automatically to whatever value you return from the checkcode
  function.  Hence, you can evaluate, massage, and alter the entered value,
  and use the results to set the current cell (as the returned value) or other
  cells(using EntryWin.setCellValue(row,col,value)).
