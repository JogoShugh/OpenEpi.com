   The following "if" statement acts on an entry in row 1 (the numerator in this
   case).  It muliplies the entry by 43 and sets the cell in row 1, column 2, to
  the result.  Then, to illustrate how to retrieve a value from the input table,
  it retrieves the value just set and displays it in an alert box.  The routine
  is nonsense, but it illustrates how to both get and set values from cells 
  in the input table.  Note that the user's entry in the current cell, and the
  row and column of the current cell are passed in the parameters of this
  function, and that the value of the current cell has not yet been set. It 
  will be set automatically to whatever value you return from the checkcode
  function.  Hence, you can evaluate, massage, and alter the entered value,
  and use the results to set the current cell (as the returned value) or other
  cells(using EntryWin.setCellValue(row,col,value)).
